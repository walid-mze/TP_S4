# **TP5 - C++ Exercises**

This repository contains solutions for the TP5 C++ exercises. Each exercise is implemented in a separate `.cpp` file.

## **Folder Structure**

```
TP5 /
│── exo1.cpp to exo6.cpp - Exercise source files
│── Makefile  # Compilation script,
```

## **Compilation and ExecutionUsage**

Each exercise is a standalone C++ file that can be compiled and executed using the provided `Makefile`.

### **Compile all exercises### **

   ```bash
   make
   ```
### **Compile a specific exercise  **
   ```bash
   make exo1
   ```
### **Run an exercise### **
   ```bash
   ./exo1  # Replace 'exo1' with the desired exercise
   ```
### **To clean compiled files: **
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
